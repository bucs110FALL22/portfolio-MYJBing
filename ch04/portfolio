Review the sample Final Projects listed below and come up with 3 possible ideas of your own for your final project. Complete this document in **your** portfolio (CH 4). A few things to note:

1. ***Don't limit yourself***
    * I will help you scale it to something manageable, but it is  uch easier to scake something down than to scale up. Shoot for the stars.

2. ***Your idea WILL change, don't worry about the details yet.***
    * Just think of a general type of game, simulation, or other kind of program you would like to create.

***

For each one below you should have a basic description of a program idea, a couple of sentences at least. You can add as much info here as you like. This is where you want to brainstorm a little, and nothing is *'wrong'*.

## Project Idea 1

< Visual jorunal. A creative comic-based journal depicting a funny mini-story with effective animations transitioned with captions. Time slots for each transitions with the time function, creative use of turtle module to draw colorful images, characters with different expressions. Usign functions and for loops to make code concise, clear and smooth for an enchanced output. Correct use of variables with matching, similar alignments to make it appealing to the audience. The story will give off a meaning to give the program a value.

## Project Idea 2

<Time bomb simulator. We will run it by making good use of the timer functions and colored animations to depict bomb exmplosion. The input can be given by the user with mouse_button_up with the pygame functions. Making good use of pygame, turtle modules to give a dangerous yet amusing vibe.   >

## Project Idea 3

< A colorful Pong game. A traditional game designed with modern attrbites, giving off an ancient vibe.By pygame, two players will be able to play the game and the highest score-gets the winner display on the screen with confetti images. We will greatly make use of turtle, pygame, functions and the loops to achieve this. Will use input function to allow the input from the user thriugh the keyboard this time.The game will keep looping until the user pauses and eventually ends by the 'pygame.quit"().  >
